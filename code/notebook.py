Example code:
# code
print("a =", a, "and b =" , b)
print(a + b)      # addition
print(a * b)      # multiplication
print(a - b)      # subtraction
print(a / b)      # division
print(b ** a)     # exponentiation
print(2 * a % b)  # modulus - returns the remainder
# code

1. Create a new cell and paste into it the assignments to the variables a and b and the contents of the code above. Remove all of the calls to the print function so you only have the expressions that were to be printed and run the code. What is returned?

2. Make a new cell with only `("a =", a, "and b =" , b)` in it. How does this output differ from when we used the print function?

3. Practice assigning values to variables using as many different operators as you can think of.

4. Create some expressions to be evaluated using parentheses to enforce the order of mathematical operations that you require
