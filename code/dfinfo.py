When we asked for the column names and their datatypes, the output was abridged, i.e. we didn't get the values for all of the columns. Can you write a small piece of code which will return all of the values

Challenge: Modify your program to output both the name and the dataype for each column. (hint: use help on the builtin `zip()` function)
