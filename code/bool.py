Try to predict what will print for each of the following (use comments to make notes).
Then run the code and summarize
your findings about what how to represent boolean values and how other values cast to
boolean type in either a markdown cell or a comment.
# code

bool_val1 = 'TRUE'
print(type(bool_val1))

bool_val2 = 'FALSE'
print(bool(bool_val2))

bool_val3 = 1
print(bool(bool_val3))

bool_val4 = 0
print(bool(bool_val4))

bool_val5 = -1
print(bool(bool_val5))

bool_val6 = -1
print(bool(bool_val6))
# break cell here
