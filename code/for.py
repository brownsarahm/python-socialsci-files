In example8 the split method is used to break the `longString` variable down into a list of individual words which are then iterated through.

Suppose that we have a string containing a set of 4 different values separated by ','  like this:

# code
variablelist = "01/01/2010,34.5,Yellow,True"
# break cell here

Research the `split()` method and then rewrite example 8 so that it prints the 4 components of `variablelist`
