1. Write a function definition to calculate the volume of a cuboid. The function will use three parameters 'H', 'W' and 'L' and return the volume.

2. Supposing that in addition to the volume I also wanted to calculate the surface area and the sum of all of the edges. Would I (or should I) have three separate functions or could I write a single function to provide all three values together?
